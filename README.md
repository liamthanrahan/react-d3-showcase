# React D3 Showcase

A showcase of the various D3 charts that I have created within the React framework

Template to create up to date React App for personal use.

I created this as I was seeing the packages we used in day to day work becoming more and more outdated and decided to figure out the compatibility issues myself as a learning experience.

## How to use

`npm install` to install the required packages.

`npm run dev` to run the code locally (once it is ready to view a browser window will be opened viewing the endpoint)

`npm run format` to manually format the code base according to the .prettierrc configuration

`npm run test` to run tests

## Todo

- [ ] Add tests for actions, reducer, selectors
